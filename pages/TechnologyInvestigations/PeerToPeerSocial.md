##### Managing social connections #####

Facebook needs massive infrastructure to support planetary social networking. But from an individual and group perspective, the phones in our pockets can handle our tens or hundreds of active connections. Thali social apps enable users to communicate directly and securely with trusted friends, family, and associates.

##### Sharing pictures and videos #####

Apps like SnapChat relay photos through the cloud. That's expensive. Thali apps exchange photos and videos directly, so if your app goes viral you won't be paying that cost.
