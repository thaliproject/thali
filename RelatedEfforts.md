# Mapping the redecentralization movement

A useful list: [https://github.com/redecentralize/alternative-internet](https://github.com/redecentralize/alternative-internet)

Let's use this space to work out a taxonomy and identify key Thali allies.

[https://pinboard.in/u:judell/t:redecentralize/](https://pinboard.in/u:judell/t:redecentralize/) is a workspace for classifying projects using multiple facets (tags). (Snapshot of that data [as JSON](http://thali.cloudapp.net/mediawiki/images/6/67/Related-efforts-folksonomy.txt) so there is a record here independent of Jon's Pinboard account.) 

Here are the tags that have emerged so far:

<pre>
ad-hoc-networking
algorithm
app
blob-store
blockchain
cjdns
darknet
disk-encryption?
distributed-hash-table
email
federated-storage
html5
ipv6
mesh-network
nosql
open-source
overlay-network
p2p
patent-protected
perfect-forward-secrecy
personal-data-store
petname
petname?
platform
private-messaging
protocol
public-key-identity
public-key-identity?
redecentralize
social-networking
sync
translucent-identity
udp-nat-traversal
webrtc
wiki
wire-encryption
xdi
</pre>

Notes:

* These terms refer to different layers of the "ISO stack" we want to visualize in order to understand where and how various projects overlap and could align. The idea here is to work bottom-up first, gather a bunch of attributes of the different projects, use Pinboard as a dynamic visualizer to see things along multiple axes and reason about them, then draw our view of the stack, then see how it compares to @jeremie's and others.

* A term ending with ? indicates uncertainty about whether a project should or should not have that attribute

* Some terms, like cjdns or tor, represent platforms or protocols on the list, so that other projects using them can be so tagged

* translucent-identity might be the wrong term, if so I'll rename, it refers to a model where identity is a one-way encrypted hash of a username/password
