title: A new backlog tracker for Thali
---
Trying out @waffleio for our [issue tracker](https://waffle.io/thaliproject/thali).

The change is driven by our desire to integrate more tightly with the issues in our GitHub repositories. See [here](http://www.goland.org/anotherthalibacklog/) for why we picked Waffle.
